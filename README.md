solve the klondike [puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_from_the_Klondike)

## Directions
Start from the heart in the center. Go three steps in a straight line in any one 
of the eight directions, north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast,
or southwest. When you have gone three steps in a straight line you will reach a 
square with a number on it, which indicates the second day's journey, as many 
steps as it tells, in a straight line in any one of the eight directions. From 
this new point, march on again according to the number indicated, and continue 
on in this manner until you come upon a square with a number which will carry 
you just one step beyond the border, thus solving the puzzle.
